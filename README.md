# My Project

Hey! Thanks for visiting my GitHub page!
This repo consists of the projects I've worked on, some for the organizations I was a part of (I created models similar to the ones I had in my project with open source data) and some for my own understanding.

Well here's a list of the notebooks.

### NLP

1. [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/arunima2407/My-Projects/blob/main/using-lstm-embedding-layer%20(1).ipynb)
This is a sentiment analysis problem where I've created and trained an LSTM using Glove Embeddings. 

2. [Multi-class Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/arunima2407/My-Projects/blob/main/bert-for-nlp-multi-class-classification.ipynb) 
I've trained a multi-class classification model using transfer learning on the [TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/distilbert) model from HuggingFace with a dataset for COVID-19 tweets which are segregated into multiple classes (Positive, Negative, Neutral, Extremely Positive and Extremely Negative). 

3. [Text Classification](https://github.com/arunima2407/My-Projects/blob/main/comparative-study-of-nlp-models%20(1).ipynb)
This is a text classification problem for which I've created and trained various NLP models such as RNN, LSTM, GRU and BiLSTM to determine the differences in output.

### Computer Vision

1. [Object detection and classification](https://github.com/arunima2407/My-Projects/blob/main/cola-bottle-classification-image-classification.ipynb)
I've trained 2 models for image classification: one from scratch, using keras and another using transfer learning from MobileNet model to predict the soda bottle name when the bottle picture is passed as an input.

2. [Facial Recognition](https://github.com/arunima2407/My-Projects/blob/main/facial-recognition-mtcnn-and-facenet.ipynb)
I've created an application using Facenet (to determine the face from the input image) and MTCNN(to carry out facial recognition) from a image dataset of bollywood actors.

### Machine learning

1. [ML Models Comparison](https://github.com/arunima2407/My-Projects/blob/main/exploratory-data-analysis-on-titanic-dataset%20(1).ipynb)
I've used the Titanic dataset for this project, and used seaborn and matplotlib libraries to understand the relationship of features on each other and finally created different ML models to study the accuracy of each.
